This example shows how to select trials based on metadata values,
aggregate data by computation / communication, and then graph
the effect of power caps on execution time.

To run the example:

./load_data.sh
./run_script.sh

WARNING! - The load_data.sh script will create a database called
"PowerExample".  In the unlikely event that a database configuration with that
name already exists, this script will overwrite it. The data loading script
should also only be executed once.
