This example shows what happens when an executable generates more threads
than TAU can handle by default.  TAU will recycle threads when there are
transient threads.  This is the new default behavior, but it can be disabled.

To disable this behavior, set the environment variable TAU_RECYCLE_THREADS=0.

To run this example:

$ make
$ ./thread_bomb
$ export TAU_RECYCLE_THREADS=0
$ ./thread_bomb
(TAU will fail)
