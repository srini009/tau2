This example shows how to use the SQLite3 plugin to store multiple trial runs
in a file-based database on disk.

To run the example, type "make", and then run the "go.sh" script.

This example assumes that TAU was configured with:

./configure -pthread -bfd=download -sqlite3=<path-to-SQLite>

(typically sqlite is installed in /usr)
