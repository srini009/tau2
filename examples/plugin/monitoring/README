This example shows how to use the PAPI component plugin to read from all 
available PAPI components (except for perf_event).

Configure PAPI with component support - as many or as few as you like
(i.e. --with-components="rapl nvml lmsensors net")

Configure TAU with:
./configure -pthread -bfd=download -mpi -papi=/usr/local/packages/papi/5.7.0
