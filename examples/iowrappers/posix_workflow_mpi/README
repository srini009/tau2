To run this example, make sure that you have configured TAU with the -iowrapper -mpi
options.

For example:

./configure -iowrapper -mpi

build the example in this directory using 'make'.  Then run the 'go.sh' script.
Make sure you have the TAU installation directory in your path. For example, at
the end of configuration you should see:

Configuration complete!
   Please add  /Users/khuck/src/tau2/apple/bin  to your path

Notes:
 - The reader and writer programs will use tau_exec to replace the IO
   calls with the wrappers in the LD_PRELOAD library from TAU, and use
   the MPI interposition library to measure MPI.
 - See the go.sh script for more details.

Then, to merge the profiles, use the tau_prof2json.py script:

tau_prof2json.py -o merged_mpi_io.json ./writer_profiles ./reader_profiles
