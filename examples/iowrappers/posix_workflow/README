To run this example, make sure that you have configured TAU with the -iowrapper
option.

For example:

./configure -pdt=/usr/local/pdtoolkit/3.24 -iowrapper

build the example in this directory using 'make'.  Then run the 'go.sh' script.

Notes:
 - The reader and writer programs will use the TAU linker to wrap IO calls.
 - The reader2 and writer2 programs will require tau_exec to replace the IO
   calls with the wrappers in the LD_PRELOAD library from TAU.
 - See the go.sh script for more details.

Then, to merge the profiles, use the tau_prof2json.py script:

tau_prof2json.py -o linker.json ./writer_profiles ./reader_profiles
tau_prof2json.py -o wrapper.json ./writer2_profiles ./reader2_profiles
