To demonstrate PAPI's counters that help with evaluation of NUMA features, we
have built this example that shows local and remote DRAM accesses. To use this,
please configure PAPI with a perf on a Linux 4.x kernel and use:
./configure -mpi -papi=<dir> -pdt=<dir> -bfd=download ; make install
cd examples/numa
make clean; make

mpirun -np 4 tau_exec -T papi -numa ./numa 
paraprof
and see the remote DRAM and total DRAM accesses. You may use Options -> Show derived metric panel to create metrics such as the ratio of remote accesses to total accesses.
