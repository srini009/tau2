When configuring TAU for use on secure or other offline systems, please
download and expand this file in the TAU root source directory:

http://tau.uoregon.edu/ext.tgz

Download and expand this file before you configure and build TAU. It will 
create a directory called external_dependencies, and the configuration
process(es) will look there for the files before attempting to download them.
